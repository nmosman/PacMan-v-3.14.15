# PacMan-v-3.14.15



TODO: Will revisit this project and make a tutorial on how to setup and create the basics. Of course now with Raspberry 4 out, will recode so the assembly complies with the newer ARM core version.

The classic arcade game Pac Man re-written in ARM assembly on a bare metal Raspberry Pi. 


Note: Screenshots of the game play as well as the environment set up will be up shortly.
